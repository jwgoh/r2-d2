But humans is not that easy.”</p></li>\n<li><p>often you have to speak up, its just a matter of your understanding of reading the situation - every player, every tournament is different</p></li>\n<li><p>usually takes a lot of time to think about it when it becomes really intense</p></li>\n<li><p>he usually stops watching the game, walks away and focusses on what to say to them in these little minutes that could really help</p></li>\n<li><p>he can usually see if it was good/not good in their faces</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Is there an instance where you were happy?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>most recent one: <a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Kiev_Major/2017">Kiev Major</a> after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2716lIq7AWM">Game 3</a> 7ckngMad was really good helping them refocus and reset</p></li>\n<li><p>important thing: you just lost 2 in a row, have to go into a third, crowd is cheering for the other team, they are unstoppable and super strong - he knows this feeling, he was there</p></li>\n<li><p>there was a risk that they felt it eventhough he wasn&#39;t sure </p></li>\n<li><p>his goal was to erase that feeling and make them confident and in control again </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>In True Sight it looked like you invested a bunch of energy into speaking to Ana and giving him an “aggressive” and “in control” mind set - is it just the way it comes over in the “True sight” or is it really what you tried?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>really what they tried since he is younger, eventhough he did win the boston major this was the hardest tournament for them as a team</p></li>\n<li><p>Fly and N0tail always fill this role and really helped ana to feel better by sharing their experiences</p></li>\n<li><p>Plan: we all have been wrong and know how it feels - now we can help giving him the correct mindset to avoid it</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Thoughts about helping this team and having a coach yourself back then?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>he would have liked someone back then when he played</p></li>\n<li><p>experience is really precious and he admires people that are sharing experience </p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>personally he is really open to it and values it as a really high gift </li>\n<li>they help you save time and move faster </li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>he is a little frustrated with coaching because he has to keep so much to himself </p></li>\n<li><p>he wants to share but he can’t since everything is so competitive</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>if you don’t share it’s pointless to know anything</li>\n<li>he really likes the type of sharing - learning - relationship</li>\n</ul></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Any regrets or bitterness that he didn&#39;t have someone like that?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>There is, but at the end he just looks at himself</p></li>\n<li><p>can’t blame anyone for not existing <em>laughter</em></p></li>\n<li><p>no one else had anyone so he has only himself to blame</p></li>\n<li><p>“It was rough times, dark times, but at least today they can help me and help the team”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Do you think OG needs this mental person some time?</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>No, everyone takes this role and he actually does it mostly because he has the most time since he is not playing </p></li>\n<li><p>it became part of what he does especially</p></li>\n<li><p>he feels like he has grown into it and they have worked for such a long time he has seen them in all situations - feeling bad, miserable, great, etc.</p></li>\n<li><p>today if he was asked to do it he would say “yeah, no problem” but at first he was very sceptical</p></li>\n<li><p>“You can break a team as easily as you can help it.”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=29m45s">Talking about the Kiev Major Final Game 5 (00:29:45)</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>sharing the progression of the games and the general feelings </p></li>\n<li><p>finals where very intense</p></li>\n<li><p>lot of respect for every team but VP especially</p></li>\n<li><p>OG knew VP would be the hardest team of the tournament because they were flying under the radar</p></li>\n<li><p>Kiev Major was the best time for them to show what they could do</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Was it more about the draft?

Chances are that you are the successful team if you figure out the patch. ”</p></li>\n<li><p>it takes a lot of time for everyone to figure the patch out </p></li>\n<li><p>Very packed dota schedule coming up so the patch will be figured out quite fast</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><em>Talking about the shrines in the base - before and after. Was it too much before?</em></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>it felt really stupid sometimes but it was nothing, you just adapt to anything</p></li>\n<li><p>he likes all updates and is willing to adapt to everyone, still thinks they were a bit too much when pushing against high ground or even going back to “base” early</p></li>\n<li><p>in the latest patch winning a lane didn’t mean much anymore because of the shrines or denies </p></li>\n<li><p>now with shrines at minute 5 it is really good</p></li>\n<li><p>it will create a gap between certain teams - teams with good laning will get an advantage</p></li>\n<li><p>in his first game he didn’t realize it and flamed his offlaner twice for using it without him as a midlaner</p>\n\n<p><em>Other things of the patch?</em></p></li>\n<li><p>the new deny-mechanic is very big, but still very vague and he needs time to find out everything</p></li>\n<li><p>he likes the new items with raindrops, mangoes and bracers - they felt kinda useless before, especially the bracers</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>“You could only build a drum and drum wasn’t even good”</li>\n</ul></li>\n<li><p>he has always been a fan of the Rod of Atos - he can’t quite make it work himself but thinks it could come to shine now</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=56m15s">Thinking back to TI6(0:56:15)</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>if they will do well this TI they will do so because of how much they learned at the TI6</p></li>\n<li><p>eventhough they finished first in the groups they felt like they played poorly compared to the rest of the year or the boot camp</p></li>\n<li><p>they learned a lot about themselves last TI - it was very rough for them</p></li>\n<li><p>the favourite position was very hard for them and he admires the ones who are favourites and can win the tournament then (like Alliance did)</p></li>\n<li><p>he hopes they won’t be the favourites for TI and that “VP are right and that we are weak”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=58m50s">Talking about the players - starting with Ana (0:58:50)</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Ana">Ana</a> is super super talented and he himself probably doesn’t understand how good he is - which is a good thing</p></li>\n<li><p>he grew a lot as a player and becomes better every day and stronger after every tournament</p></li>\n<li><p>7ckngMad would be afraid if he would be in another team</p></li>\n<li><p>he thinks MMR doesn’t matter that much but indicates some things </p></li>\n<li><p>Ana was already very good but exploids his potential faster than they could even hope</p></li>\n<li><p>his main strength is that he doesn’t pressure himself and is not cocky with things - things just happen, he doesn’t do things because he is OG.Ana, he just does things - “not like S4, who doesn’t even talk to people”</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><a href="https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h1m16s">Jerax (1:01:16)</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>“<a href="http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/JerAx">Jerax</a> makes me feel bad about myself everyday.

You know how good you are? You could make it, you know?”\n\n- now 7ckngMad just sits at home and watches this guy owning\n\n- he was feeling really happy about how far MinD_ContRoL came and just felt like tweeting something for him\n\n- really flashy Shaker plays, good positioning and Echos eventhough he didn\'t play the hero in a long time\n\n- back then when 7ckngMad met MC he was a sick mid player playing as DP or SF\n\n- epi had one interview with MC and thinks he has super high dota IQ - while [Matumbaman] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/MATUMBAMAN) was just memeing and trolling in the background of the interview\n\n- Talking about the Earth Shaker and good spell usage for the fellow 4k scrub (epi and myself)\n\n- after like 10 games you realize how to do it - Totem in the Fog, Fissure from the Fog (important), blink in, right click, totem again, second totem damage - best damage output\n\n- MC just looked really smooth even without playing him a long time\n \n[Coaching (0:08:00)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=8m)\n\n- talking about respect of the team and other players since switching to the manager position\n\n- first generation of transitioning from active pro players switching to coaching\n\n*Do you think people can become coaches without them being former pro players?*\n\n- rough question, he did think about it\n\n- defining what coaching really is is different\n\n- the mental part might be doable but they have to understand what it takes and what you need to play dota competitively\n\n- he doesn’t think you can understand the dota part without being involved with that inside, the meta game, the evolving of meta, etc.\n\n*Is there a need for coaches that were not pro players and maybe another for strategy?*\n\n- yes, because it’s really rough to do both at the same time\n\nWhat was your learning curve? Any challenges?\n\n- fly approached him and he took like 1-2 months to accept it\n\n- 7ckngMad had to ask himself if he had what it takes - not technically, but expressing yourself, when to push them, when to be passionate and when not to\n\n- as a player you don’t want to listen to someone so it’s hard to coach someone\n\n- since he did never have a coach it is not easy\n\n- in the end he just wanted to give it a shot and try it out\n\n- since he was always captaining he has his very own ideas on the game\n\n- they weren’t the ideas from OG, so they could learn from him\n\n- he also had to adapt and learn from the way OG played since he didn’t wanna get them closer to his idea but the other way around\n\n*Would you say this skill is now learned? Like to when you have the impulse if you see something and say it?*\n\n- it is learned but still sometimes the situation is debatable in his mind if he wants to say something or not\n\n- usually problematic when it’s “high stake” games or when they lose and he thinks “is it good here? did i do a mistake? \n\n*Are there circumstances for coaches to speak up and say something?*\n\n- when he started the first thing he said “under no circumstances i want to be the mental coach because i know how sensitive that is”\n\n- played with so many players and knows how hard it is to get everyone on the same page\n\n- “I’m down to coach you guys, but it’s only Dota. That’s easy, that’s simple math for me. But humans is not that easy.”\n\n- often you have to speak up, its just a matter of your understanding of reading the situation - every player, every tournament is different\n\n- usually takes a lot of time to think about it when it becomes really intense\n\n- he usually stops watching the game, walks away and focusses on what to say to them in these little minutes that could really help\n\n- he can usually see if it was good/not good in their faces\n\n*Is there an instance where you were happy?*\n\n- most recent one: [Kiev Major] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Kiev_Major/2017) after [Game 3] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2716lIq7AWM) 7ckngMad was really good helping them refocus and reset\n\n- important thing: you just lost 2 in a row, have to go into a third, crowd is cheering for the other team, they are unstoppable and super strong - he knows this feeling, he was there\n\n- there was a risk that they felt it eventhough he wasn\'t sure \n\n- his goal was to erase that feeling and make them confident and in control again \n\n*In True Sight it looked like you invested a bunch of energy into speaking to Ana and giving him an “aggressive” and “in control” mind set - is it just the way it comes over in the “True sight” or is it really what you tried?*\n\n- really what they tried since he is younger, eventhough he did win the boston major this was the hardest tournament for them as a team\n\n- Fly and N0tail always fill this role and really helped ana to feel better by sharing their experiences\n\n- Plan: we all have been wrong and know how it feels - now we can help giving him the correct mindset to avoid it\n\n*Thoughts about helping this team and having a coach yourself back then?*\n\n- he would have liked someone back then when he played\n\n- experience is really precious and he admires people that are sharing experience \n\n\t- personally he is really open to it and values it as a really high gift \n\n\t- they help you save time and move faster \n\n- he is a little frustrated with coaching because he has to keep so much to himself \n\n- he wants to share but he can’t since everything is so competitive\n\n\t- if you don’t share it’s pointless to know anything\n\n\t- he really likes the type of sharing - learning - relationship\n\nAny regrets or bitterness that he didn\'t have someone like that?\n\n- There is, but at the end he just looks at himself\n\n- can’t blame anyone for not existing *laughter*\n\n- no one else had anyone so he has only himself to blame\n\n- “It was rough times, dark times, but at least today they can help me and help the team”\n\nDo you think OG needs this mental person some time?\n\n- No, everyone takes this role and he actually does it mostly because he has the most time since he is not playing \n\n- it became part of what he does especially\n\n- he feels like he has grown into it and they have worked for such a long time he has seen them in all situations - feeling bad, miserable, great, etc.\n\n- today if he was asked to do it he would say “yeah, no problem” but at first he was very sceptical\n\n- “You can break a team as easily as you can help it.”\n \n[Talking about the Kiev Major Final Game 5 (00:29:45)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=29m45s)\n\n- sharing the progression of the games and the general feelings \n\n- finals where very intense\n\n- lot of respect for every team but VP especially\n\n- OG knew VP would be the hardest team of the tournament because they were flying under the radar\n\n- Kiev Major was the best time for them to show what they could do\n\n*Was it more about the draft? Can you share the focus of the drafts in these games? Was it ursa?* \n\n- 7ckngMad has to make sure that he doesnt leak to much\n\n- the way VP drafted was very expected and that was not what was so hard\n\n- OG knew what they would do almost any game\n\n- they did a big mistake in Game 5 drafting wise, where not cautious enough - took a risk and paid a hard price for it\n\n- it was a disaster, he felt really bad at this point\n\n- VP also drafted really well of course\n\n*At what point did you think “Fuck”?*\n\n- when VP picked the Alchemist\n\n- OG had the plan to pick it themselves - thought VP forgot about it but they really didn’t - Vp was not behind but even ahead \n\n- OG kind of got ahead of themselves and assumed something wrong and paid the price\n\n*Thoughts on them picking OD afterwards?*\n\n- funny because they actually used it themselves in Boston to kick out EG\n\n- thinks VP had it from OG but they were too blind to actually see it \n\n- When the stake is the highest you get yourself in the hardest situation - like fighting your own strategy\n\n- the same thing happened in TI6 against TNC Game 2 when they played against Huskar Drow - a strat they used themselves a lot in that tournament (next topic, just finishing that one)\n\n- he thinks about that Game every day\n\t\n*What was the moment “shit we lost” and the moment “ok we got this”?*\n\n- he always tries to be very rational “Ok, they have the better draft, that’s how it is going to go down”\n\n- looking at it “we can still do this, that” and then if you look at it rationally it is so over\n\n- but Dota is not all about that - anything can happen\n\n- Coaching is way to stressful - at 2-18 he went out of the practise room, to the crowd, screamed “OG” like a fan and gave them his energy - and it worked\n\n- that victory was very satisfying for him because there is nothing that he did (other than a little mind set) \n\n- VP switched it up and all the strategy was gone, all was on the players, nothing he could do from a coach perspective\t\n\n- that’s when he wanted to stop stressing and just believing into these sick players\n\n- it’s an honor for him to coach for this team, this family, it was great to just stand in the crowd as a fan - it’s not as efficient and he didn’t do it for a long time\n\n- he even saw VP-Shirts cheering for OG, then for VP, but just for the action and dota in general - that was really great\n \n[Impressions and Thoughts about True Sight (0:42:21)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=42m21s)\n\n- It’s a very little part that has been shown from the public\n\n- a lot of things were not shown from OG and definitely from VP also\n\n- there is nothing wrong from the OG side of the documentary\n\n- Valve influenced the outcome by not showing some things but showing other things\n\n- 7ckngMad thinks it’s wrong to assume something without knowing the background of the people and what they think while saying things\n\n- first start a discussion and talk with them about that and then just talk bad\n\n- the way everyone reacted is dislikable\n\n- VP talks very aggressive “OG is bad, stupid, etc.”\n\n- he doesn’t feel offended at all - everyone has their own way to motivate themselves, if that’s their way, there is nothing wrong with that\n\n- OG and VP players respect each other immensely \n\n- any team that you meet in a major is worth your respect\n\n- if they say how they are portrayed is wrong then he wants to believe them\n\n- he doesn’t have enough information to make his own mind but he would never offend them\n\n- “In general, everyone just has to respect they ways of each and everyone. If that is the way for them to motivate then that’s just it. There is noone to judge. There is no offense taken whatsoever.”\n \n[7.06 patch (0:47:50)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=47m50s)\n\n*Are you enjoying the new patch?*\n\n- 7ckngMad likes it a lot and has a lot of ideas\n\n- it is however just theory crafting now, they didn’t talk about it yet \n\n- difficult times since everyone has new ideas - meta is going to change\n\n- it’s a bigger patch than people think\n\n- “There is always two dimensions - whoever figures out the patch and whoever is successful. Chances are that you are the successful team if you figure out the patch. ”\n\n- it takes a lot of time for everyone to figure the patch out \n\n- Very packed dota schedule coming up so the patch will be figured out quite fast\n\n*Talking about the shrines in the base - before and after. Was it too much before?*\n\n- it felt really stupid sometimes but it was nothing, you just adapt to anything\n\n- he likes all updates and is willing to adapt to everyone, still thinks they were a bit too much when pushing against high ground or even going back to “base” early\n\n- in the latest patch winning a lane didn’t mean much anymore because of the shrines or denies \n\n- now with shrines at minute 5 it is really good\n\n- it will create a gap between certain teams - teams with good laning will get an advantage\n\n- in his first game he didn’t realize it and flamed his offlaner twice for using it without him as a midlaner\n\n *Other things of the patch?*\n\n- the new deny-mechanic is very big, but still very vague and he needs time to find out everything\n\n- he likes the new items with raindrops, mangoes and bracers - they felt kinda useless before, especially the bracers\n\n\t- “You could only build a drum and drum wasn’t even good”\n\n- he has always been a fan of the Rod of Atos - he can’t quite make it work himself but thinks it could come to shine now\n \n[Thinking back to TI6(0:56:15)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=56m15s)\n\n- if they will do well this TI they will do so because of how much they learned at the TI6\n\n- eventhough they finished first in the groups they felt like they played poorly compared to the rest of the year or the boot camp\n\n- they learned a lot about themselves last TI - it was very rough for them\n\n- the favourite position was very hard for them and he admires the ones who are favourites and can win the tournament then (like Alliance did)\n\n- he hopes they won’t be the favourites for TI and that “VP are right and that we are weak”\n \n[Talking about the players - starting with Ana (0:58:50)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=58m50s)\n\n- [Ana] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Ana) is super super talented and he himself probably doesn’t understand how good he is - which is a good thing\n\n- he grew a lot as a player and becomes better every day and stronger after every tournament\n\n- 7ckngMad would be afraid if he would be in another team\n\n- he thinks MMR doesn’t matter that much but indicates some things \n\n- Ana was already very good but exploids his potential faster than they could even hope\n\n- his main strength is that he doesn’t pressure himself and is not cocky with things - things just happen, he doesn’t do things because he is OG.Ana, he just does things - “not like S4, who doesn’t even talk to people”\n \n[Jerax (1:01:16)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h1m16s)\n\n- “[Jerax] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/JerAx) makes me feel bad about myself everyday. I hate him. He is just so good.”\n\n- there is a lot of pressure on pos 4 right now and everything he does has such a big impact\n\n- “You need to be someone that handles pressure better than anyone else and he does that extremely well. [...] I can tell that he is gifted, you know.”\n \n[s4 and N0tails tweet about s4 masterminding(1:03:46)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h3m46s)\n\n- “I always admired him as a player even when i played against them back then.”\n\n- he remembers back then when [s4] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/S4) played against Funzii (7ckngMads midplayer) and it was the puck/magnus matchup - in the first game puck kills magnus, then magnus kills puck \n\n- then he goes to Funzii “Dude, i need to understand from a drafter\'s perspective - which hero is better? - Well, it depends. - What do you mean, depends on what? - It depends on what s4 is playing.”\n\n- he had this untouchable, dota legend aura and he still has that “there is something weird about that guy in the best way that i can put it. I keep getting impressed by this guy.”\n\n- he thinks s4 is a really smart player and has an “instinct”, it just happens \n\n- he looked very silent in true sight but in games he makes a lot of calls \n\n- you can tell him winning a TI makes sense - “That’s part of the s4 level.”\n\n- he is really smart about the way he communicates - not noisy but he knows when it’s the right time to talk and when it’s not needed “He is on the s4 level. That’s why he communicates like s4.”\n \n[BigDaddyN0tail (1:09:16)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h9m16s)\n- there is so much to say about this guy - 7ckngMad learned so much on a human and dota level from [N0tail] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/N0tail)\n\n- “He is one of the smartest guys i have met.”\n\n- everyone does a lot for the team, but him especially - what he brings is very unique and needed and he is the only one what brings it to the team\n\n- it’s “human things” hard to explain \n\n- “He is one of the sickest Dota players out there.”\n\n- the flame on his plays was because people didn’t get what he was trying to do - he didn’t start to play better suddenly\n \n[Fly (1:11:49)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h11m49s)\n\n- “[Fly] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Fly) is probably the best captain in Dota that i know. He has my complete admiration. He is a great leader. He is like a rock. Whenever it’s needed, he’s there.”\n\n- he is the calm type of a captain, but also gets hyped sometimes. he is also very smart about when to express himself\n\n- “You can’t be a captain if you are selfish. You have to give it all to the team and that’s what he does.”\n\n- especially when they lose were the times when he stepped up\n \n[Thoughts about EGM leaving Alliance (1:15:30)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h15m30s)\n\n- [EGM] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/EGM) has been working really hard lately and Mad likes him and wishes him all the results he is hoping for \n\n- if they part ways with him is probably because there was not enough motivation to play with each other\n- has not watched them closely enough to have a real opinion\n\n- “Whenever you work hard, you get rewarded at some point. Even if you feel that you don’t, you miss it. You’re gonna be rewarded no matter what. ” \n\n- he says that you gain a lot of experience and that is very important, eventhough you hope to gain something else like money or fame or anything \n\n- even in the darkest times, hard work pays off\n \n[Next few weeks/months - Preparation for OG (1:20:14)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h20m14s)\n\n- heading to the Manila Masters next, straight after that Moskau Epicenter\n\n- June will be a little bit calmer, then [MDL] (http://wiki.teamliquid.net/dota2/Mars_Dota_2_League/2017) (Chinese tournament), then boot camp for TI in NA (hopefully)\n \n[BEEF (1:21:20)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h21m20s)\n\n- Tweets between Mad and PPD - kinda said hi to each other at some events\n\n- “Truth is I can be a moron on twitter, i know it. And the community let me pay the hard price. I don’t hold any grudge, i think i deserve anything i got.”\n\n- still has a lot of respect for ppd, feels like he was arrogant sometimes but doesn’t hold beef to anyone, just sometimes has a “mediterranean temper”\n\n- still didn’t change his opinion about the topic - of course today things are very different\n\n- 7ckngMad didn’t mind the whole shitstorm\n \n[Dota Community and Reddit in general (1:24:43)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h24m43s)\n\n- “Whenever i go to a LAN i realize why i am passionate about this game. It is mainly about the community and the fans.”\n\n- “There is something wrong with online sometimes.”\n\n- people should understand that players are emotional \n\n- “As much as support matters, anti-support also matters.”\n\n- everyone should try to put themselves into the player perspective if they would want to read things about themselves like that\n\n- some players get affected by it and it makes him sad\n\n- “I wish there was only LANs in Dota.”\n \n[Public Service Announcement (1:27:06)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h27m06s)\n\n- “I don’t have the best behaviour in pubs so i can’t really say anything out of place.”\n\n- playing a lot of pubs is very rough emotionally because you get a lot of retards - and he is one of them\n\n- he works on his behaviour though and says he has gotten better\n\n- “Be as open minded as possible. The only way you improve is thanks to others.”\n\n- everyone might know something you don’t know and can help you become better\n\n- “I don’t think it’s ever gonna change.”\n\n- Just put yourself in question after every game\n \n[Last words (1:32:01)] (https://youtu.be/fz48P30p25s?t=1h32m01s)\n\n- “Shoutout to everyone out there, honestly.

    selftext: '###Matchmaking Changes\n\n* As an experimental change for a few days, All Pick will now have **25 heroes randomly removed from the hero pool at the start** of the draft before the ban phase. *This change only affects Ranked Matchmaking*. \n\n---\n\n###Other Changes\n\n* In today\'s update we are changing how commands are processed in Dota to address some user input contention and improve responsiveness. Previously if you cast a spell and before it finished casting, you cast two spells afterwards, only the last spell would be cast. The order queue was only 1 deep effectively. This usually has no practical impact, except for things with really fast/instant cast time done in sequence. Here are a few examples of how the behavior would be different:\n\n**Example 1:**\n\nAxe casts battle hunger. While the cast animation is playing, Axe quickly uses a Blink Dagger and then Berserker\'s Call.\n\n- Old Rules: Only Berserker\'s Call is cast. The blink dagger order is ignored.\n- New Rules: Axe will use the Blink Dagger, then cast Berserker\'s Call.\n\n\n**Example 2:**\n\nPuck casts Illusory Orb. Puck then casts Dream Coil. While the cast animation of Dream Coil is playing, Puck quickly casts Ethereal Jaunt and Waning Rift.\n\n- Old Rules: Only Waning Rift would have triggered and Puck would not have teleported with Ethereal Jaunt.\n- New Rules: Puck teleports with Ethereal Jaunt and then casts Waning Rift in the new location.\n\n\nThis change applies generally to all orders that are issued when your hero is in another action (like during a cast animation or while stunned), and the order needs to enter the queue. Issuing a movement command or stop will still empty the queue same as before, if you decide you no longer want to issue the orders in the queue. ###Matchmaking Changes\n\n* As an experimental change for a few days, All Pick will now have **25 heroes randomly removed from the hero pool at the start** of the draft before the ban phase. *This change only affects Ranked Matchmaking*. \n\n---\n\n###Other Changes\n\n* In today\'s update we are changing how commands are processed in Dota to address some user input contention and improve responsiveness.
